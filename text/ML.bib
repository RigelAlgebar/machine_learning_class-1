abstract = {A long-standing dream in the large scale application of solar energy conversion is the fabrication of solar cells with high-efficiency and long-term stability at low cost. The realization of such practical goals depends on the architecture, process and key materials because solar cells are typically constructed from multilayer heterostructures of light harvesters, with electron and hole transporting layers as a major component. Recently, inorganic-organic hybrid lead halide perovskites have attracted significant attention as light absorbers for the fabrication of low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells via a solution process. This mainly stems from long-range ambipolar charge transport properties, low exciton binding energies, and suitable band gap tuning by managing the chemical composition. In our pioneering work, a new photovoltaic platform for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was proposed, which yielded a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12{\%}. The platform consisted of a pillared architecture of a three-dimensional nanocomposite of perovskites fully infiltrating mesoporous TiO2, resulting in the formation of continuous phases and perovskite domains overlaid with a polymeric hole conductor. Since then, the PCE of our PSCs has been rapidly increased from 3{\%} to over 20{\%} certified efficiency. The unprecedented increase in the PCE can be attributed to the effective integration of the advantageous attributes of the refined bicontinuous architecture, deposition process, and composition of perovskite materials. Specifically, the bicontinuous architectures used in the high efficiency comprise a layer of perovskite sandwiched between mesoporous metal-oxide layer, which is a very thinner than that of used in conventional dye-sensitized solar cells, and hole-conducting contact materials with a metal back contact. The mesoporous scaffold can affect the hysteresis under different scan direction in measurements of PSCs. The hysteresis also greatly depends on the cell architecture and perovskite composition. In this Account, we will describe what we do with major aspects including (1) the film morphology through the development of intermediate chemistry retarding the rapid reaction between methylammonium or formamidinium iodide and lead halide (PbI2) for improved perovskite film formation; (2) the phase stability and band gap tuning of the perovskite layer through the materials engineering; (3) the development of electron and hole transporting materials for carrier-selective contacting layers; and (4) the adoption of p-i-n and n-i-p architectures depending on the position of the electron or hole conducting layer in front of incident light. Finally, we will summarize the recent incredible achievements in PSCs, and finally provide challenges facing the future development and commercialization of PSCs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome in need of improved phenotypic classification. We sought to evaluate whether unbiased clustering analysis using dense phenotypic data (phenomapping) could identify phenotypically distinct HFpEF categories. METHODS AND RESULTS We prospectively studied 397 patients with HFpEF and performed detailed clinical, laboratory, ECG, and echocardiographic phenotyping of the study participants. We used several statistical learning algorithms, including unbiased hierarchical cluster analysis of phenotypic data (67 continuous variables) and penalized model-based clustering, to define and characterize mutually exclusive groups making up a novel classification of HFpEF. All phenomapping analyses were performed by investigators blinded to clinical outcomes, and Cox regression was used to demonstrate the clinical validity of phenomapping. The mean age was 65±12 years; 62{\%} were female; 39{\%} were black; and comorbidities were common. Although all patients met published criteria for the diagnosis of HFpEF, phenomapping analysis classified study participants into 3 distinct groups that differed markedly in clinical characteristics, cardiac structure/function, invasive hemodynamics, and outcomes (eg, phenogroup 3 had an increased risk of HF hospitalization [hazard ratio, 4.2; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.0-9.1] even after adjustment for traditional risk factors [P{\textless}0.001]). The HFpEF phenogroup classification, including its ability to stratify risk, was successfully replicated in a prospective validation cohort (n=107). CONCLUSIONS Phenomapping results in a novel classification of HFpEF. Statistical learning algorithms applied to dense phenotypic data may allow improved classification of heterogeneous clinical syndromes, with the ultimate goal of defining therapeutically homogeneous patient subclasses.},

abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20{\%} relative improvement to 62.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {This Perspective highlights how the methodology of reaction progress kinetic analysis can provide a rapid and comprehensive kinetic profile of complex catalytic reaction networks under synthetically relevant conditions in a fraction of the number of experiments required by classical kinetic analysis. This approach relies on graphical manipulation of the extensive data sets available from accurate in situ monitoring of reaction progress under conditions where two concentration variables are changing simultaneously. A series of examples from Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions of aryl halides demonstrates how a wealth of kinetic information may be extracted from just three experiments in each case. Even before proposing a reaction mechanism, we can determine reaction orders in substrates, propose a resting state for the catalyst, and probe catalyst stability. Carrying out this kinetic analysis at the outset of a mechanistic investigation provides a framework for further work aimed at seeking a molecular-level understanding of the nature of the species within the catalytic cycle. To be considered plausible, any independent mechanistic proposal must be shown to be consistent with this global kinetic analysis.},

In the past, such a decomposition was obtained using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) where images were vectorized before being factored by NMF. A tensor factorization (NTF) on the other hand preserves the 2D representations of images and provides a unique factorization (unlike NMF which is not unique). The resulting "factors" from the NTF factorization are both sparse (like with NMF) but also separable allowing efficient convolution with the test image. Results show a superior decomposition to what an NMF can provide on all fronts - degree of sparsity, lack of ghost residue due to invariant parts and efficiency of coding of around an order of magnitude better. Experiments on using the local parts decomposition for face detection using SVM and Adaboost classifiers demonstrate that the recovered features are discriminatory and highly effective for classification.},

abstract = {The dynamics of complex isothermal reactors are studied in general terms with special focus on connections between reaction network structure and the capacity of the corresponding differential equations to admit unstable behavior. As in some earlier work, the principal results rely on a classification of reaction networks by means of an easily computed non-negative integer index called the deficiency. This index often provides nontrivial information about the kind of dynamics that can be expected. Part of the previously reported Deficiency Zero Theorem is substantially generalized by the Deficiency One Theorem. The foundation is laid for a companion article containing a theory of multiple steady states generated by reaction networks of deficiency one. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Computational phenotyping is the process of converting het-erogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) into meaningful clinical concepts. Unsupervised phenotyping methods have the potential to leverage a vast amount of labeled EHR data for phenotype discovery. However, existing unsupervised phenotyping methods do not incorporate current medical knowledge and cannot directly handle missing, or noisy data. We propose Rubik, a constrained non-negative tensor fac-torization and completion method for phenotyping. Rubik incorporates 1) guidance constraints to align with existing medical knowledge, and 2) pairwise constraints for obtain-ing distinct, non-overlapping phenotypes. Rubik also has built-in tensor completion that can significantly alleviate the impact of noisy and missing data. We utilize the Alternat-ing Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework to tensor factorization and completion, which can be easily scaled through parallel computing. We evaluate Rubik on two EHR datasets, one of which contains 647,118 records for 7,744 patients from an outpatient clinic, the other of which is a public dataset containing 1,018,614 CMS claims records for 472,645 patients. Our results show that Rubik can discover more meaningful and distinct phenotypes than the baselines. In particular, by using knowledge guidance constraints, Rubik can also discover sub-phenotypes for sev-eral major diseases. Rubik also runs around seven times faster than current state-of-the-art tensor methods. Finally, Rubik is scalable to large datasets containing millions of EHR records.},

@article{Ho2014,
abstract = {The rapidly increasing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) from multiple heterogeneous sources has spearheaded the adoption of data-driven approaches for improved clinical research, decision making, prognosis, and patient management. Unfortunately, EHR data do not always directly and reliably map to medical concepts that clinical researchers need or use. Some recent studies have focused on EHR-derived phenotyping, which aims at mapping the EHR data to specific medical concepts; however, most of these approaches require labor intensive supervision from experienced clinical professionals. Furthermore, existing approaches are often disease-centric and specialized to the idiosyncrasies of the information technology and/or business practices of a single healthcare organization. In this paper, we propose Limestone, a nonnegative tensor factorization method to derive phenotype candidates with virtually no human supervision. Limestone represents the data source interactions naturally using tensors (a generalization of matrices). In particular, we investigate the interaction of diagnoses and medications among patients. The resulting tensor factors are reported as phenotype candidates that automatically reveal patient clusters on specific diagnoses and medications. Using the proposed method, multiple phenotypes can be identified simultaneously from data. We demonstrate the capability of Limestone on a cohort of 31,815 patient records from the Geisinger Health System. The dataset spans 7. years of longitudinal patient records and was initially constructed for a heart failure onset prediction study. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness, stability, and the conciseness of Limestone-derived phenotypes. Our results show that using only 40 phenotypes, we can outperform the original 640 features (169 diagnosis categories and 471 medication types) to achieve an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.720 (95{\%} CI 0.715 to 0.725). Moreover, in consultation with a medical expert, we confirmed 82{\%} of the top 50 candidates automatically extracted by Limestone are clinically meaningful.},

@article{Lee1999,
abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

The current surge in MHP research has largely arisen out of their rapid progress in PV devices; however, these materials are potentially suitable for a diverse array of optoelectronic applications. Like oxide perovskites, MHPs have ABX3 stoichiometry, where A and B are cations and X is a halide anion. Here, the underlying physical and photophysical properties of inorganic (A = inorganic) and hybrid organic–inorganic (A = organic) MHPs are reviewed with an eye toward their potential application in emerging optoelectronic technologies. Significant attention is given to the prototypical compound methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) due to the preponderance of experimental and theoretical studies surrounding this material.
