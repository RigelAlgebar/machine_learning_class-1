Write your name on the notebook that you are working on, and once you finish, add a number to explain what has been done:

1 Is the theory correct? 

2 Does the examples use only the tools we showed previously? (this is not a big deal but lets try to keep it ordered).

3 Is the notebook intended for physics, engineering or art?

4 Grammar edition.

5 Style edition.
